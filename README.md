Market Website

Hello,

This is a webforms school project using ASP.NET and SSMS(SQL).

If you wish to view the project, you will need to clone this repository on your own machine and use the two SQL files(Customers & Products) to be able to properly view the website.

And also if you are not familiar with VS2022, you will need to open the solution to operate the website : Projet_AppTrans.sln.

This is my first time doing this, so hopefuly this works :)

Have a wonderful day.
